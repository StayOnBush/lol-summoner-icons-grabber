# LOL "Summoner Icons" Grabber

Grab all summoner icons using javascript

I created this repository because of mine and several other [requests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68397916/riot-api-how-to-get-summoner-profile-icon-image/76195049#76195049) on StackOverflow

## Getting Started

Just clone this repo and run the index.html file in your browser. The embedded script will download all images to your harddrive.
Consider changing your download directory before doing so!

## Improve the script

If you like the script and want to participate, feel free to do so. For example there could be an improvement on the download url to get the most current api version instead of hardcoding it. The api versions can be fetched from [this link of Riot Games ddragon](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/api/versions.json)
